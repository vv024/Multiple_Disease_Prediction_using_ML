# Multiple Disease Prediction System using ML
### Build a Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning. The system should be able to predict the presence of four diseases: diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and breast cancer. Additionally, develop a web application using the Streamlit library in Python, where users can input specific attributes or values for each disease and obtain the corresponding prediction.
